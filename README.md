# Book Recommendation System with KNN & Collaborative Filtering
This repository implements a book recommendation system using unsupervised learning (K-Nearest Neighbors) and collaborative filtering techniques. This project was developed for Task 3 of the Uneeq Internship.
# Objective:

Develop a system that recommends books to users based on their preferences and similar user ratings.
# Approach:
* **Data Acquisition**:Used the [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation] dataset containing book information and user ratings.
* i implemented KNN  with sparse csr_matrix
* **Collaborative Filtering**: Leveraged user-item ratings to find books enjoyed by users with similar tastes.
* **Recommendation Generation**: Combined KNN and collaborative filtering recommendations to suggest relevant books to the user.
* **Streamlit Interface**: Built a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for users to explore recommendations.
# Technology Stack:

* Python (programming language)
* Pandas (data manipulation library)
* NumPy (numerical computing library)
* Scikit-learn (machine learning library)
* Streamlit (web framework for building data apps)
